# Event-driven Solution gitOps catalog

The GitOps Catalog includes kustomize bases and overlays for a number of OpenShift operators needed
to develop event-driven solution and services.

This is using the same structure as introduce by Red Hat COP team in [this repository](https://github.com/redhat-cop/gitops-catalog).

## Usage

Each catalog item has its own README.md for future instructions. Be sure to use the most recent `oc` CLI.

See the download page [here](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/clients/ocp/stable/).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jbcodeforce/eda-gitops-catalog.git
```

Then apply on one of the defined product or operator.

## Kustomize

You can reference bases for the various tools here in your own kustomize overlay without 
explicitly cloning this repo, for example:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

namespace: product-catalog-cicd

resources:
- github.com/jbcodeforce/eda-gitops-catalog/kafka-strimzi/operator/base/?ref=main
```

This enables you to patch these resources for your specific environments. 
Note that none of these bases specify a namespace, in your kustomization overlay 
you can include the specific namespace you want to install the tool into.
